Highlights of significant contributions: One page with 3 to 4 paragraphs\\

Paragraph 1: Importance and relevance of Topic, reported issues and limitations of the topic in performance or computation etc, issues involved in those limitations, need for addressing those issues and a short note on how that is addressed in this report.


Paragraph 2 Objectives of this work, short note on algebraic methods used and formulations achieved, computational procedures developed. \gls{ic}.


Paragraph 3: Description of simulation procedure including SW tools used and choice of test cases. Short note on results achieved and significant highlights of improvements if any in terms of percentage , for example the architecture presented in this report shows 22 \% improve in power consumption as compared to the previously reported articles.
\gls{ic}

Paragraph 4:The last para needed only if emulation (after simulation) or Hardware developed to validate simulation results in para 3.
